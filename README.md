# Python Web Scrapper for Monster.com :snake:

![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Python%20Web%20Scraping-brightgreen?logo=python)

A web scrapper that fetches specific job openings from a particular country by performing a search query on [Monster](https://www.monster.com/) (an employment website). This web scrapper also offers an additional functionality, where the user can fetch the application link for the job openings containing a specific keyword.

**Motivation:** A while a back I was looking for some internships, where I was manually going on different websites and making a list of the desired internships that were being offered by differnet companies. In order to make this tedious process less time consuming, I came up with an idea to write a python script which will help me in fetching desired job positions from a specific website.

**NOTE:** As of 28/06/2020, this script is fully functional and provides the desired functionality as mentioned above.

**Happy Coding :octocat:!**
